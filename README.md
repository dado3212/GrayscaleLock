Grayscale Lock is a Cydia tweak that allows you to set grayscale status on an app-by-app basis.  In our modern day of phone addiction, more and more people are turning to grayscale to try and reduce how much they use it ([see articles like this one](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/technology/grayscale-phone.html)), and this tweak makes it more convenient than ever.

### Installation

To install it, either install from the .deb, or add the repository http://cydia.alexbeals.com to Cydia and download GrayscaleLock.
